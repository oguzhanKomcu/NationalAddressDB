# NationalAddressDB
It is a script that contains database information as Turkey's province, district, neighborhood.

If you want to use detailed address information in your projects and keep a record accordingly, you can use this script file to get the province, district, district/neighborhood information in Turkey. In addition, there is a table called "Countries" with the country code and names.

Download the file for use. Open MsSql. Create a new database from the Database section and set its name as "NationalAddressDB" or edit the database name in the script according to the name you want. Open the file in MSSQL. Then run the script.

This database can also be found on the Internet. I wanted to share it here so that it can be found and used more easily.
